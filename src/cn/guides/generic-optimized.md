title: Choosing between the generic and optimized build
---

This [[guides/index|guide]] provides an overview of the differences between the generic and optimized builds of Zen, so you can make an informed decision on which version to use.

> [!info]
> This guide only applies to the Linux and Windows versions of Zen.

## Supported CPUs for optimized builds

> [!warning]
> If your computer's processor doesn't belong to any of the following processor families, the optimized version won't work on your device. Please install the generic version instead.

* AMD Family 17h (Zen, Zen+, Zen 2)
* AMD Family 19h (Zen 3)
* AMD Family 19h (Zen 4 / Zen 4c)
* AMD Family 1Ah (Zen 5 / Zen 5c)

### Intel

## Differences between the optimized and generic builds

The optimized version of Zen leverages [Advanced Vector Extensions 2](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions#Advanced_Vector_Extensions_2) (AVX2), a CPU instruction set that enhances performance for certain computational tasks. This instruction set is only available on modern processors.
