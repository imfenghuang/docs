DRM is commonly used by streaming services to protect copyrighted content. When you try to play DRM-protected content, the website verifies if the necessary DRM software is available on your browser. Most browsers use <a href="./www.widevine.com"><strong>Widevine</strong></a>, a DRM technology developed by Google, to facilitate this.</p></blockquote><p>Zen Browser currently lacks DRM-support, because it does not have a Widevine license. Acquiring such a license requires the payment of large fees (at least $5,000). Acquiring this license is financially unresponsible for the developer of Zen. This means that DRM-protected media cannot be played in Zen Browser for the foreseeable future. If support grows and the developer receives sufficient funding, a Widevine license may be considered.</p><p>Feel free to support the funding of a Widevine license for Zen on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/zen_browser" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ko-Fi</a> or <a href="https://www.patreon.com/zen_browser" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Patreon</a>!</p><blockquote><p>[!question]- Which Services Are Affected?
